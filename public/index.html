                <h6>1. Learning</h6>
                <p>
                  At the 2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference, 15 year old climate change activist Greta Thunberg sent shockwaves around the world through her striking and scathing speech criticising the leaders of the world for their inaction towards global warming. Although global warming has been increasingly calamitous for the past few decades, Thunberg’s speech pushed us to evaluate our carbon footprint. In contemporary society, energy consumption is integrated into every mechanism of our lives: transportation, shelter, communication, commerce, and more, are all heavily influenced by our demand for energy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this study, we’ll be investigating one component of energy demand: transportation. This sector accounts for over 7 billion metric tons of CO2 emissions each year. To that end, the advent of electric modes of transportation over the last decade has challenged the foothold that conventional cars have in the energy sector. The dichotomy between EV’s and conventional cars is of great concern for how individuals directly drive global energy consumption.
                </p>
                <h6>2. Winnowing</h6>
                <p>We consulted statistics from the CORGIS Dataset to understand the cost per kWH in the US on a state by state level. This informs us on the relative stability of electricity and the cost for EV users. In addition, we consulted outside sources such as the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and more to confer time series data about the price of gasoline over time, the average fuel economy of conventional vehicles, and other statistics inherent to conventional driving.</p>

                <p>3. Discover: Characterize your problem by identifying at least two tasks that you will want to conduct with your data. Enumerate the tasks using the 5Ws framework that we talked about in-class (see Lecture 16). Make sure to outline the process by which you were able to generate these specific tasks.   </p>
                <p>4. Design: Create a low-fidelity prototype of a visualization designed to address these tasks. Add brief design justifications and discussions of the trade-offs of key design choices in the prototype. Make sure to include an image of the prototype in your write-up (note: since this is a low-fi prototype, sketches lacking real data are perfectly sufficient). </p>
                <p>5. Implement: Implement your design as a more polished digital or physical data representation. You can use any tool of your choosing, but if you elect to use a WYSIWYG tool like Tableau or Excel, please incorporate design choices beyond the defaults provided by the tool. Note how you've implemented your solution, justify the resulting design based on your tasks, research on the problem space, and any formative investigations (see the discussion of the presentation below), and include at least one image of the visualization using real data in the write-up. Note that you can choose to pare down the dataset for simplicity if you'd like.</p>
                <p>6. Deploy: Use your visualization with your target data to conduct the tasks you outlined in Step 3. Note your observations about the data gained through these tasks. </p>
                <p>7. Iterate: Note at least one new task you'd conduct now that you've had a chance to investigate your dataset. Describe how you would change your solution to accommodate that task. You do not have to implement that change, but may do so for extra credit (see Bells & Whistles at the end of this document). </p>
                <h4>Analysis</h4>
                <p>8. Reflect, Pt 1: Describe what your solution tells you about your target problem. Note that you will do this with your domain expert hat on. What recommendations would you be able to provide on future policy directions and what historical patterns support those recommendations? Note that you may want to do a little digging into relevant data correlated with the patterns you observed (e.g., economic or socio-political events).</p>
                <p>9. Reflect, Pt2: Describe what your solution tells you about designing visualizations for your target problem. Note that you will do this with your designer hat on.
