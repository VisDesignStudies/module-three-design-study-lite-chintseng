                <h4>Precondition</h4>
                <p>1. Learning: Provide a brief background for your target problem. Make sure to describe the problem and why it matters. I encourage you to narrow down the problem scope more tightly than what's presented in the scenario, focusing on a specific line of policy and/or historical patterns (e.g., patterns in economic factors or data about coal usage). </p>
                <p>2. Winnowing: Figure out what data you will use to explore the problem. You are welcome, but not required, to bring in data outside of the provided dataset. Make sure to talk about the background of the data (e.g., where does it come from, what bias might it have, etc) and why it's useful for your question. Note that you should explain the specific columns/dimensions of the dataset you plan to use and why these are necessary and sufficient to support your approach. </p>
                <h4>Core</h4>
                <p>3. Discover: Characterize your problem by identifying at least two tasks that you will want to conduct with your data. Enumerate the tasks using the 5Ws framework that we talked about in-class (see Lecture 16). Make sure to outline the process by which you were able to generate these specific tasks.   </p>
                <p>4. Design: Create a low-fidelity prototype of a visualization designed to address these tasks. Add brief design justifications and discussions of the trade-offs of key design choices in the prototype. Make sure to include an image of the prototype in your write-up (note: since this is a low-fi prototype, sketches lacking real data are perfectly sufficient). </p>
                <p>5. Implement: Implement your design as a more polished digital or physical data representation. You can use any tool of your choosing, but if you elect to use a WYSIWYG tool like Tableau or Excel, please incorporate design choices beyond the defaults provided by the tool. Note how you've implemented your solution, justify the resulting design based on your tasks, research on the problem space, and any formative investigations (see the discussion of the presentation below), and include at least one image of the visualization using real data in the write-up. Note that you can choose to pare down the dataset for simplicity if you'd like.</p>
                <p>6. Deploy: Use your visualization with your target data to conduct the tasks you outlined in Step 3. Note your observations about the data gained through these tasks. </p>
                <p>7. Iterate: Note at least one new task you'd conduct now that you've had a chance to investigate your dataset. Describe how you would change your solution to accommodate that task. You do not have to implement that change, but may do so for extra credit (see Bells & Whistles at the end of this document). </p>
                <h4>Analysis</h4>
                <p>8. Reflect, Pt 1: Describe what your solution tells you about your target problem. Note that you will do this with your domain expert hat on. What recommendations would you be able to provide on future policy directions and what historical patterns support those recommendations? Note that you may want to do a little digging into relevant data correlated with the patterns you observed (e.g., economic or socio-political events).</p>
                <p>9. Reflect, Pt2: Describe what your solution tells you about designing visualizations for your target problem. Note that you will do this with your designer hat on.

            <p data-paragraph="main" style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;">But what are the actual dangers of using cannabis? To help you decide whether to load another bowl or put the bong down for good, we’ve summarized the latest science on marijuana’s health risks; the areas where there’s an absence of evidence that pot is risky (think: lung cancer); and, finally, the surprising reason why the director of the the federal agency in charge of studying how drugs are bad thinks adults could possibly benefit from using cannabis.</p>
            <h4 style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;">The risks are real</h4>
            <p data-paragraph="main" style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;">Many of pot’s effects are tangled in contradictory research, but there are a few clear health risks to consuming the drug. Smoking cannabis regularly can <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/add.15075" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cause</a> bronchitis-like symptoms, and research <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0258434" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published last month</a> found that chronic cannabis users, defined as people who used pot at least four times a week for more than three years, had impaired pancreatic function. There have also been <a href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/19344-a-rare-case-of-cannabis-induced-acute-pancreatitis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cases</a> of daily cannabis users developing pancreatitis without having any other obvious risk factors.</p>
            <p data-paragraph="main" style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;">Regular pot use has also been associated with higher rates of depression, anxiety and poorer life outcomes like being unemployed, but causality <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4827335/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has not been established</a> because other factors could predispose someone both to using cannabis and having a mental illness or not having a job.</p>
            <p data-paragraph="main" style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;">There’s also evidence that cannabis can be dangerous when used in certain situations, like during pregnancy or while driving a vehicle. A <a href="https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-021-08598-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent study</a> linked increasing rates of childhood leukemia to an increase in cannabis use, and <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/47/e2106115118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a separate study</a> found a correlation between women using cannabis while pregnant and their children having higher rates of anxiety. There’s also evidence that using pot while pregnant can lead to lower birth weights, although that evidence is still <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2594400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered</a> limited. And driving a car while high has been shown to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26878835/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moderately increase</a> the risk of getting into a motor vehicle accident.</p>

          <div class="col-md-auto" style="width: 70%;">
            <p style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;">Deborah Hasin, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, said she is very concerned about adults’ increasing use of cannabis because CUD is associated with poorer quality of life, cognitive decline and impaired educational and occupational employment. Hasin’s research has found that 19.5 percent of people who use cannabis met the criteria of CUD in their lifetimes.

              “It’s clear that not everybody who smokes marijuana has all of these problems, but the risk is there, and it’s a greater risk than people assume,” Hasin said.
              
              Using cannabis frequently increases the risks of developing CUD, and frequent pot use is growing among adults. Monthly use for 26-to-34-year-olds has more than doubled since 2008, and the share of people getting at least five days a week increased from 5.8 to 13.8 percent between 2008 and 2019, according to NSDUH survey results.</p>
